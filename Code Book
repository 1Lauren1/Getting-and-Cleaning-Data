Code Book

This code book describes the original data used to create the tidy dateset.

Overview

Smartphone captured data.

Explanation of files

features.txt: Names of the 561 features.
activity_labels.txt: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

X_train.txt: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.

subject_train.txt: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in X_train.txt.
y_train.txt: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in X_train.txt.

X_test.txt: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.

subject_test.txt: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in X_test.txt.
y_test.txt: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in X_test.txt.
More information about the files is available in README.txt. More information about the features is available in features_info.txt.

Data files that were not used

This analysis was performed using only the files above, and did not use the signal data. Therefore, the data files in the "Inertial Signals" folders were ignored.

Processing steps

All the relevant data files were read into data frames with appropriate column headers were added, and the training and test sets were combined.
All columns were removed that did not contain the  "mean()" or "std()". This left 66 feature columns.
A tidy dataset was created containing the mean of each feature for each subject and each activity.
The tidy data set was created into a pdf. file to upload.
